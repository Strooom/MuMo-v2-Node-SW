In order to run this target unit tests, you need to take following HW setup :
* testPort = UART2 = USB, normally COM26

This test tries to verify all of the hardware after manufacturing
* show something on the display
* test the EEPROM, both devices
* test the UART1 via loopback
* test the presence of I2C sensors
